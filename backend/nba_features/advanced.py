# backend/nba_features/advanced.py
"""
Attaches pre-calculated historical/seasonal advanced statistical splits to game data.

This module takes an input DataFrame of games and another DataFrame containing
pre-calculated seasonal advanced stats (with home/away splits, often from an RPC
or a processed data source like 'nba_team_seasonal_advanced_splits').
It looks up the relevant season's home performance stats for the home team and
away performance stats for the away team, and attaches them to each game.
Differentials between these historical stats are also calculated.
